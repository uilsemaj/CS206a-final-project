"""Please write a Python program which interfaces with ROS to control a Rethink Robotics Sawyer Bot to have easily changeable end effector velocities in cartesian coordinates as a function of time"""
"""To control the Sawyer robot's end effector velocities in cartesian coordinates using ROS, you can use the InteractiveMarker interface in ROS. This interface allows you to create an interactive marker in RViz, which you can then move to change the end effector velocities of the robot.

Here is an example of how you might do this in Python:"""
